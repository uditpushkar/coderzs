A very common asked question is about our domain name and how does it work locally. When we launched [filepanda, and our preliminary homepage](http://blog.sdslabs.co.in/2010/11/hello-world/) a long time ago, we had been using the easy to remember IP address <http://192.168.208.208>.

Now, however we are using the domain name sdslabs.co.in for all our services, including [DC](http://dc.sdslabs.co.in). To understand how this works, you will have to understand how the name resolution of a domain name takes place. 

>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.

DNS is basically a service which resolves domain names to IP addresses. If you own a domain name, you can point it to wherever you want. This is usually done in the administration panel of your hosting services. We have setup multiple domains on our nameserver ([mitsu.in](http://mitsu.in) as of the moment) to point to the IP address 192.168.208.x. 

For instance [sdslabs.co.in](http://sdslabs.co.in) points to `192.168.208.208`, [echo.sdslabs.co.in](http://echo.sdslabs.co.in) points to `192.168.208.204` and so on. This is done via updating something called `A records` (this is the part of resolution which transaltes to IPv4 addresses). 

The benifits of having such a system in place are enormous:

- Users don't have to remember IP addresses, and can easily remember the site address.
- We can move around services, applications over different machines, and it will only take a single update to change the name resolutions
- We could add alternative fallback servers easily (by having multiple A record entries) for a domain. We could even use this to point sdslabs.co.in domain to something that is hosted online, for instance.
- We can have catchy, and simple to remember urls for eg <https://sdslabs.co.in/login>, and <https://sdslabs.co.in/logout>

Also, we are running all our services on https, which _is not dependent upon the visibility of the website_. Even though the site is hosted locally, the process of certificate signing remains exactly the same as any other site. Once we aquire a SSL certificate and attach it to our web-server, the visibility of the domain does not matter to the browser at all.

Note: For the benifit of those not in IIT Roorkee, we are running multiple web-service on the domain sdslabs.co.in, which is only served locally, as it resolves to a local IP address (192.168.208.208)
