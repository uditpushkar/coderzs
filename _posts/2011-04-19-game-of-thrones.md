title: Game Of Thrones
---
For the uninitiated, Game Of Thrones is a high budget fantasy TV series currently being screened on HBO. It is based on George R.R Martin's epic fantasy, A Song Of Fire & Ice, book one of the Game Of Thrones series. 
I had started reading the book a few weeks ago (not knowing then about the TV series), but never quite got the time. However after the highly promoted Trailer, and the absolutely brilliant episode 1, I've picked up the book once again.

I've decided to keep myself aloof from all the spoilers, and read the book along with the series. This means that I will be finishing the book in a very long time, but also that I will be able to get a much better insight into what is going on the series. For eg there are very many characters in the TV series, which are not yet introduced, and it was interesting to see them come upfront in the book.

Is anyone else reading the book for the first time along with the TV series ? 

Below is the ground from the book that each episode contains. I will continue to update this as the series goes ahead :

Episode :

1. Chapters 1-8
2. Chapters 9-17
3. Chapters 18-24\*
4. Chapters 25-29
5. Chapters 30-35

\* Only half of the chapter is present in the respective episode.

Let me know what you think of Game Of Thrones in the comments...
