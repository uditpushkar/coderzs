Finally, from being a complete programmer to a designer as well, who can create a css template using Paint.Net. Photoshop is way too outlandish for me, you see. It wasn't easy, but it was definately fun. The template was based on a wallpaper by http://leon-gao.deviantart.com. The final template is still unnamed. Hope you all like it, and there is a demo available at http://nemo.criitique.in/worries .
