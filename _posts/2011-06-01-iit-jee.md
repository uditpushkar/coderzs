title: IIT-JEE 2011 Results
---

I worked out the entire IIT-JEE 2011 results and the end result is available [here](/projects/iitjee). In case anyone finds any errors in the data, please open an issueat [github](https://github.com/captn3m0/captn3m0.github.com/issues). You can also contact me by [other means](/contact/). As always a disclaimer applies, and I'm not responsible for any mistakes in this listing. I've intentionally removed the Application Form Number (partially) in the results, so that it may not be misused. I'm thinking of trying a full-scale birthday permutation attempt on the JEE site for the Application Form. What do you think? Will it be worth it?
