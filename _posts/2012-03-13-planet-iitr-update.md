So, I was just going through my old blog posts, and saw the [Planet IITR Update](http://captnemo.in/blog/2011/07/09/announcing-planet-iitr/), which I created out of a need for people to be able to find blogs from other people in IITR.

Since no one has ever submitted a single link to the [planet](http://www.planetaki.com/iitr) , I just thought, why shouldn't I just crawl all my Facebook friends from IIT-R, and check their website URLs. The Facebook part took ~20 minutes (getting list of users from my 2 friendlists, followed by getting the website url for each of those friends). After that came the link checking part, which tool ~15-20 minutes as well. A list of all the websites (very few people fill up that that field on fb) I found during the search is [here](http://www.hastebin.com/quhexokere.dos) (just 39).

After updating the [planet](http://www.planetaki.com/iitr), I had to update the spreadsheet as well. And [here's a list of the blogs](http://www.planetaki.com/iitr/subscriptions), just in case.

In case someone is interested in taking over maintenance (meaning link curation) for [Planet](http://www.planetaki.com/iitr), please contact me at <capt.n3m0@gmail.com>, and I'll be glad to share the authentication details with you.

In case you were wondering what this planet stuff is all about, it allows one to add a single curated feed to one's feed reader and get all updates via that. So planet iitr is a curated collection of blogs pertaining to IIT-R.
