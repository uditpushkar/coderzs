[Planet IIT-R](http://www.planetaki.com/iitr/) is a blog collection similar to the [Planet Ubuntu](http://planet.ubuntu.com), [Wordpress](http://planet.wordpress.com), and the likes. The basic idea is to create a single address where all blogs of IIT-R are aggregated. This way, people can easily follow happenings and blogs at IIT-Roorkee without individually following various blogs. I've added a few blogs to it already, including those of [Divye Kapoor](http://divye.in), Sanath Rath, [Wona](http://wona.co.in), Arasu and the likes.

A complete list of blogs in the planet is available at <http://www.planetaki.com/iitr/subscriptions/>

**Update**: There is also a feature in planetaki to suggest a website for the planet. Unfortunately, you need to be logged in to planetaki (ie create a planet) to suggest a site. In case you are, you can use [the suggestions](http://planetaki.com/iitr/subscriptions/suggest) feature to suggest websites.

To suggest a blog to add to the list, please use the form below. You can also see the current spreadsheet [here][ss] :
