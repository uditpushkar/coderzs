Firstly, a frank admission.

>I procastinate.  
>A lot.  
>Seriously.

For every second I spend in front of my computer, trying to get some work done, there is a continous struggle going on between my "work" and "play" side of things. Unfortunately, the "play" side seems to be winning. **A lot**. So I decided to wage a war against it.

Here is my arsenal of tools:

- [get-shit-done](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done) - Script blocks all access to various sites(FB,reddit etc)
- [Chrome Profiles](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=142059) - One of my profiles is called "get-shit-done". It features my development extensions, apps, bookmarks, and nothing else. It is plain vanilla Chromium with no puffy unicorns luring me to check my Facebook Notifications.

- Music - I find Youtube a surprising good source of music discovery. I listen to almost everything. Recently, I've started to listen to [Ludovico Einaudi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB3wgiaOOvA). You may also like <http://musicforprogramming.net/> in this regard. 
- Minimal Tabs - I close a tab as soon as I'm done with it. This leads to ~3-5 tabs in my "get-shit-done" setup. A lesser number of tabs usually means a limit on the number of distracting links. Even Stackoverflow doesn't help in this regard.
- The get-shit-done profile even has settings to clear cache at closings. This leads to me being signed out of everything. Including GMail, Facebook, SO, and everything else. In this mode, I login to something, if it is essential to the work at hand. 
- [Read It Later](http://www.readitlater.com/) - I've setup all [Hacker News](http://hckrnews.com) feeds above 20 points to be saved automatically to my Read It Later account, which I can easily consume on my iPad at my leisure. However, I find myself itching to browse hckrnews every 5 minutes.

If you find yourself browsing facebook, reddit, youtube, hacker news, or reading blog posts on productivity, I urge you strongly to try this out. Defeating procastination is not easy. And its never a win-or-lose battle. What are your thoughts? How do you stop yourself from getting lost on the internetz? Tell me in comments.
