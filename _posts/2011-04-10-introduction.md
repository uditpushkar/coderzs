Welcome to my github pages. This will be my personal code blog site, or something of that sort. I will soon be transitioning this site to Jekyll for easier publishing and maybe move away from wordpress. (Done)

I am a proficient coder in PHP, working on various internal projects at SDSLabs.

Here is my current setup :

* Dell Inspiron 1545
* T-6400 Intel Core 2 Duo
* Ubuntu Oneric Ocelot 11.10 (Default Primary OS)
* <del>[Elementary OS][eos] (Under Testing)</del> Will be moving to Gnome Shell soon
* <del>[Samurai WTF][samurai], [Backtrack 5][bt5]</del> for pen-tests
* Moved from Windows after remaining a staunch supporter for 5 years
